  <h1>Religio.ai</h1>
  <blockquote>“To see your soul mapped—not to change it, but to recognize its resonance.”</blockquote>

  <p><strong>Religio.ai</strong> is an open-source platform for mapping, remixing, and translating belief systems. It helps individuals articulate and refine their deepest values—what we call their <strong>Bible Wiki</strong>—in a living, forkable format. Some draw from ancient traditions like Christianity, Buddhism, or Judaism. Others remix new paths like Synthology, Animist Tech Ethics, or the Gospel of Joy.</p>

  <p>At its core, Religio.ai treats belief systems as <em>waveforms</em>—dynamic, evolving, and resonant across difference. The platform lets you <strong>see your own structure clearly</strong>, then harmonize with others through structured metaphor translation, parable-based inquiry, and contrast-aware mapping. It's like GitHub for theology meets Duolingo for worldviews.</p>

  <div class="sidebar">
    <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
    <p>Most of us carry beliefs we’ve never been asked to name. We inherit them. We resist them. We remix them. Religio.ai gives those beliefs a shape—so you can speak them with clarity, share them with grace, and <strong>translate across traditions without distortion</strong>.</p>
    <p>In an age of polarization, Religio invites resonance. Not erasure. Not flattening. But structured difference—visible, navigable, and full of meaning.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Current Components</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Profile Questions</strong> — Deep prompts like: Who do you turn to for truth? What do you owe the dead? What makes something sacred?</li>
    <li><strong>Bible Wikis</strong> — Living, remixable documents of belief that can be forked, versioned, or anchored in any tradition.</li>
    <li><strong>Parables & Narrative Surveys</strong> — Story-based instruments for surfacing implicit convictions, used for translation and mapping.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Who It's For</h2>
  <p>Anyone building meaning: spiritual seekers, interfaith bridge-builders, post-religious ethicists, AI philosophers, Web3 ritual architects, or just humans looking to understand each other better.</p>

  <h2>Get Involved</h2>
  <p>Religio.ai is early-stage, but already alive. We're collecting stories, belief profiles, comparative taxonomies, and meta-theological design patterns. You don’t need to code. You just need to care.</p>
