  <h1>Religio.ai</h1>
  <blockquote>“To see your soul mapped—not to change it, but to remember it.”</blockquote>

  <p><strong>Religio.ai</strong> is an open-source spiritual profiling and publishing project. It helps individuals articulate, refine, and share their deepest beliefs—what we call their “Bible Wiki”—in a living format. These wikis can draw on traditional religions like Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, or weave together new paths like Synthology, Punk Ethics, or the Gospel of Joy.</p>

  <p>The project centers on a set of questions—some personal, some parable-based—that help people uncover what they actually believe about creation, suffering, justice, kinship, responsibility, death, and joy. The answers are structured and relational, so your beliefs can be compared and mapped next to others: your ancestors, your friends, or a stranger on the other side of the world.</p>

  <div class="sidebar">
    <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
    <p>Most of us carry beliefs we’ve never spoken aloud. We inherit them. We resist them. We remix them. Religio gives those beliefs a name, a shape, and a home—so you can see yourself more clearly, and recognize your neighbors more kindly.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Current Components</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Profile Questions</strong> — Who do you turn to for truth? What is sacred to you? How do you define a good death?</li>
    <li><strong>Bible Wikis</strong> — Custom, forkable belief documents rooted in cultural traditions and living experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Parables & Surveys</strong> — Narrative tests and story-questions that help surface deep convictions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Get Involved</h2>
  <p>This project is in its early stages. Right now, we’re collecting stories, parables, ethical reflections, profile responses, and design ideas for a future relational spiritual platform. You don’t need to code. You just need to care. Reach out, reflect, remix.</p>
